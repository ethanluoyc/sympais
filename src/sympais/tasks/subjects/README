Since we ran the mathematica experiments in a different machine 
(r3.large instance in AWS), we decided to run Mathematica directly
without having qCORAL as a middle man. For that, we:

 - converted the inputs to mathematica format (using the
   MathematicaCaller and MathematicaVisitor classes);

 - wrapped the calls to NProbability in a timing function
   (AbsoluteTiming)

 - used this new script as input for mathematica (check the runMath.sh
   script for more details).

The input files are spread over 4 folders:

 - exponential: VolComp and qCORAL benchmarks, all variables are
   exponentially distributed. Used in table 4.

 - normal: VolComp and qCORAL benchmarks, all variables are normally
   distributed. Used in table 4.

 - twonormal: VolComp and qCORAL benchmarks, two of the variables are
   normally distributed. Used in table 3.

 - montecarlo: Same as "normal", but uses Monte Carlo as the
   integration method in the calls for NProbability. Not used anywhere
   in the paper; we used it for debugging/validation.

#we didn't include the VOL benchmark in the experiments due to
#performance reasons (Mathematica and qCORAL+discretization can't
#handle the large amount of variables in this subject). Also, it only
#has a single, non partitionable constraint.
